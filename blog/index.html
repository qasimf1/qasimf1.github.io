                    <img src="images/industrial.jpg" alt="woman and factory">
                    <p>As her due date approached, my cat gave birth to six precious bundles of fur. I dedicated
                         myself to nurturing both mother and kittens, ensuring they had everything they needed to 
                         thrive. Yet, just as I thought our family was complete, fate intervened once again. One 
                         stormy night, my cat returned home injured, her fur matted and eyes pleading for help. 
                         With a heavy heart, I rushed her to the vet, praying for her swift recovery.

                    <img src="images/routine.jpg" alt="i love doing londary">
                    <p>One day, to my surprise, my beloved cat returned home with a round belly, a telltale sign that she 
                     was expecting. I was overjoyed at the thought of becoming a grandmother to a litter of adorable
                     kittens. Despite my financial constraints as a full-time student, I was determined to give her the
                     best care possible. I researched kitten care extensively, stocking up on supplies and preparing a
                     cozy nest for the impending arrivals.

                    <p>As she grew, my little Russian cat developed a curious spirit, yearning to explore the world 
                        beyond our home. Despite my initial worries, I couldn't bear to confine her indoors. So, with a 
                        heavy heart, I let her venture into the great outdoors, knowing she was happiest under the open 
                        sky. Watching her chase butterflies and climb trees filled me with both pride and anxiety,
                         knowing the dangers that lurked outside our safe haven.
